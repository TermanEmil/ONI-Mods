# Changes

* ## Heat and Energy
    * Most buildings' heat outputs balanced to the energy input

* ## Water
    * Polluted water is created in a 1.3 to 1 ratio from water
    * Water is refined from polluted water in a 1 to 1.3 ratio

* ## Duplicants:
    * Convert 25% of the mass they inhale to CO2
    * Emit packets of CO2 in 100 gram packets
    * Emit the remaining 75% of mass (sometimes) as warmer O2
