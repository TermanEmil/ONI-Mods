# Changes

## Heat and Energy
 * Most buildings' heat outputs balanced to the energy input

## Water
 * Polluted water is created in a 1.3 to 1 ratio from water
 * Water is refined from polluted water in a 1 to 1.3 ratio

## Duplicants:
 * Convert 25% of the mass they inhale to CO2
 * Emit packets of CO2 in 100 gram packets
 * Emit the remaining 75% of mass (sometimes) as warmer O2

## Water Sieve
 * Heat output reduced to 120 DTU/s
 * 100% of sand input (1 kg) now converted to polluted dirt
 * Water output reduced to 3.8462 kg/s

## Algae Distillery
 * Polluted water output reduced to 350 g/s from 400 g/s
 * Added clay output of 50 g/s

## Carbon Skimmer
 * Heat output reduced to 120 DTU/s
 * Polluted water creation increased to 1.3 kg/s

## Oxygen Diffuser
 * Heat output reduced to 120 DTU/s
 * Removed minimum output temperature
 * Additional polluted oxygen creation at 50 g/s

## Electrolyzer
 * Heat output reduced to 120 DTU/s
 * Minimum output temperatures removed

## Deodorizer
 * Output element changed to polluted dirt rather than clay

## Coal Generator
 * Energy output increased to 1000W

## Hydrogen Generator
 * Heat production reduced to 400 DTU/s
